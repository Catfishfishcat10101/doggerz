# Archived scripts

These scripts are not used by the app build, sprite pipeline, or CI checks.

They were kept for historical reference while reducing clutter in the main `scripts/` folder.

If you need them again:

- `slice-grid.py` slices a grid spritesheet into per-frame WEBP files.
- `write-metas.mjs` writes `_meta.json` files from `frame-plan.jrt-real-v1.json`.
- `frame-plan.jrt-real-v1.json` is a legacy plan for a previous ("real v1") frame source.
